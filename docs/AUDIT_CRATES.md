# Crate Distribution Audit

**Note (2025-12-15):** Crate pools have been cleaned to cosmetic-only rewards, and `openCrate` now enforces cosmetic-only selection server-side. Update any regenerated audits to reflect current pool sizes (357 cosmetics per crate).

This document outlines the crate distributions generated by the `buildCrateDistributions.js` tool.

## Crate Summary

| Crate Name | Eligible Items | Total Weight | Pity Settings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Common Crate` | 49 | 49 | N/A |
| `Rare Crate` | 49 | 49 | N/A |
| `Exotic Crate` | 49 | 49 | N/A |
| `Legendary Crate` | 49 | 49 | N/A |
| `Mythical Crate` | 49 | 49 | N/A |

## Notes

- The current implementation of `buildCrateDistributions.js` uses an equal distribution model, where each eligible item is assigned a weight of 1.
- Pity settings have not been implemented yet. This will be addressed in a future iteration.
- The eligible item count is based on a simplified filtering logic. This will be refined to support more complex rarity-based filtering.
